# PhillyCrimeOpenSource
A reboot of the PhillyCrime.ipynb notebook from the first week of UW's Machine Learning:  Regression course on Coursera

## Motivation
I grew up with R.  My experience with Python and its open source machine learning frameworks was very limited prior to starting UW's Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.  I was, as seems to be a common theme, a little disappointed with the specialization's emphasis on Graphlab, a proprietary framework.  So, to get some familiarity with available tools, I redid the PhillyCrime.ipynb notebook from the first week using Pandas and Statsmodels.  I'm putting the result up here for anyone interested.
